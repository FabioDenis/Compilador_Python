Grammar

Rule 0     S' -> expression
Rule 1     expression -> expression PLUS term
Rule 2     expression -> term
Rule 3     term -> NUMBER

Terminals, with rules where they appear

NUMBER               : 3
PLUS                 : 1
error                : 

Nonterminals, with rules where they appear

expression           : 1 0
term                 : 1 2

Parsing method: LALR

state 0

    (0) S' -> . expression
    (1) expression -> . expression PLUS term
    (2) expression -> . term
    (3) term -> . NUMBER

    NUMBER          shift and go to state 3

    expression                     shift and go to state 1
    term                           shift and go to state 2

state 1

    (0) S' -> expression .
    (1) expression -> expression . PLUS term

    PLUS            shift and go to state 4


state 2

    (2) expression -> term .

    PLUS            reduce using rule 2 (expression -> term .)
    $end            reduce using rule 2 (expression -> term .)


state 3

    (3) term -> NUMBER .

    PLUS            reduce using rule 3 (term -> NUMBER .)
    $end            reduce using rule 3 (term -> NUMBER .)


state 4

    (1) expression -> expression PLUS . term
    (3) term -> . NUMBER

    NUMBER          shift and go to state 3

    term                           shift and go to state 5

state 5

    (1) expression -> expression PLUS term .

    PLUS            reduce using rule 1 (expression -> expression PLUS term .)
    $end            reduce using rule 1 (expression -> expression PLUS term .)
